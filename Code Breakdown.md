### Code Breakdown
The description and usage of all the functions present in `6G Digital Twin.py` is briefly explained below:

1. **`distance`**:
   - **Description:** Calculates the Euclidean distance between two nodes. Used for distance calculation in various functions.
   - **Usage:** Provide the nodes as input and function results the distance between the nodes.

2. **`edge_association`**:
   - **Description:** Performs grouping of input nodes and edges based on a given threshold distance.
   - **Usage:** Input the `nodes`, `edges` and `threshold` and function returns the associated edges.

3. **`adaptive_edge_association`**:
   - **Description:** Performs edge association with a dynamic threshold that changes according to presence of nodes in the threshold distance.
   - **Usage:** Input the `nodes`, `edges`, `threshold` distance and `learning_rate` (rate at which threshold is to be increased per interation) and function returns associated edges accordingly.

4. **`transfer_learning_digital_twin_migration`**:
   - **Description:** Transfers the weights to given layers if present in both source and target models that are given as input.
   - **Usage:** Input the `source_model`, `target_model`, `layers_to_transfer` and function returns the weights that can be updated in the model.

5. **`select_initial_state`**:
   - **Description:** Selects the initial state for deep reinforcement learning.
   - **Usage:** Used in the `deep_reinforcement_learning_digital_twin_placement` to select random choices from nodes.

6. **`select_action_epsilon_greedy`**:
   - **Description:** Chooses an action based on an epsilon-greedy policy in reinforcement learning.
   - **Usage:** Input the `q-values`, `state`, `actions` and `exploration_rate` and function here returns random actions based on `exploration_rate`
7. **`transition`**:
   - **Description:** Used in the `deep_reinforcement_learning_digital_twin_placement` function to define the transition to the next state based on the selected action.
   - **Usage:** Input the `current_state` and `selected_action` and function returns next state. 

8. **`get_reward`**:
   - **Description:** Used in the `deep_reinforcement_learning_digital_twin_placement` function for determining the reward based on the current state and selected action. The function here has predefined actions but can be redefined as per usage.
   - **Usage:** Input the `current_state` and `selected_action` and the function returns the action if it is found in the action value map

9. **`deep_reinforcement_learning_digital_twin_placement`**:
   - **Description:** Function iteratively updates Q-values through multiple `episodes` (sequence of states, actions and rewards, starting at initial state, and ending at final state) and `time steps` (individual steps or iterations in an episode), selects action using epsilon-greedy policy, transitions between states based on actions and updates q-values and returns final q-values after training.
   - **Usage:** Input `graph`, `nodes`, `edges`, `actions`, `rewards`, `q_values`, `learning_rate`, `discount_factor`, `exploration_rate`, `max_episodes` and `max_time_steps` to return updated Q-values after Q-Learning.

10. **`kmeans_edge_association`**:
    - **Description:** Performs edge association using k-means clustering on nodes.
    - **Usage:** Input the `graph`, `nodes`, `edges` and `k` to result associated nodes.

11. **`initialize_q_values`**:
    - **Description:** Used in the `reinforcement_learning_edge_association` function to initialize Q-values for each state-action pair.
    - **Usage:** Input the `threshold` and `actions` to result Q-values.

12. **`update_threshold_edges`**:
    - **Description:** Used in the `reinforcement_learning_edge_association` function to update nodes and edges based on the selected action.
    - **Usage:** Input the `nodes`, `edges` and `action` and the function updates the nodes and edges.
13. **`calculate_reward`**:
    - **Description:** Used in the `reinforcement_learning_edge_association` function to calculate the total reward based on a dictionary of rewards and a list of selected edges.
    - **Usage:** Input the `edges` and `rewards` to return and appropriate reward for an action.

14. **`reinforcement_learning_edge_association`**:
    - **Description:** Initializes Q-values and updates them iteratively using Q-learning.
    - **Usage:** Input the `graph`, `nodes`, `edges`, `threshold`, `learning_rate`, `exploration_rate`, `discount_factor` and `max_episodes` and the function returns final Q-values after reinforcement learning.
